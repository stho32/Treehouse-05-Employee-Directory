# Treehouse-05-Employee-Directory

This is the 5th project for the team treehouse techdegree as a javascript full stack developer.

See [requirements](Documentation/Requirements.md) for the instructions.

The folder "Provided-Files" contains the files like teamtreehouse provided them for the project.

You might also be interested in my [notes](Documentation/Notes.md) where I share my thoughts about why I chose one way of solution over another.

In a nutshell, this project is about creating an employee directory using a third party API to 
get sample data. Treehouse provides the requirements and 2 mockups. 

I try to become better at measuring and guessing time. For an insight into what I did and how long it took you may have fun looking at my [time-log](Documentation/time-log.md)
